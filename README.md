# Product Color Changer

A simple way to customize the color of a product image. This demo uses only 2 images (photo & mask) with a canvas technique to blend images together.

## How to use
1. The object in a photo to be colorized should be grayscale to allow for better blending. 
2. Create a mask of the object to be colorized and save with transparency.
3. To finish simply modify the example code, replacing with your images.
4. Adjust the gray tones and mask as needed to achieve desired results.


This demo uses a version of the [Pixastic](https://github.com/jseidelin/pixastic) library to do the image blending.
